A place for puzzle solvers to coordinate during a hunt

The current hunt is the [2017 MIT Mystery Hunt](/mysteryhunt)

## Where's what?

Code specific to a particular hunt should live in that hunt's folder.  Our
dumping ground for random code is [sandbox](/sandbox).  Code in sandbox may move
or disappear at anytime.  If you don't know where to put something, put it in
its own directory in sandbox.
